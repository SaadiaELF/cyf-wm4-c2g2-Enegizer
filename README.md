### Details
- ***Squats***: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. With your toes pointed slightly out, engage your core, bend your knees and push your hips back as you squat down until your thighs are parallel with the ground. Remember to keep your chest up. Hold your hands straight in front or clasp your hands in front — whatever is most comfortable.
- ***High knees***: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Maintaining a straight posture, lift one knee to your chest, rapidly switching to your other leg. If helpful, begin by jogging in place first. Engage your core as you switch from leg to leg at jogging or sprinting pace.
- ***Leg swings***: Standing straight and keeping your hips aligned, swing one leg forward and backwards in a single smooth movement. Switch sides and repeat to complete the set (10 swings/leg). You can use a wall, fence, or pole to maintain balance throughout the dynamic exercise. It is also helpful to start with light leg swings first and gradually extend your range of motion throughout the duration of the stretch.
- ***Lunges***: Start standing straight up. Engage your core and take a big step forward with your right leg, shifting your weight so your heel lands first. Then, lower your body until your right thigh is parallel to the floor and your right shin is vertical. Press into your right heel to drive yourself back to the starting position. Repeat for the left leg.
- ***Jumping jacks***: Begin standing straight with your legs together and arms flat at your sides. Bend your knees slightly and jump into the air, spreading your legs shoulder-width apart and stretching your arms out and over your head. Jump to return back to the starting position and repeat.
- ***Hip circles***: Stand straight with your feet hip-width apart. While keeping your hands together in front of your stomach, pull your knee up until it is parallel with the floor. Then, pull the knee back, opening up your hip. Return to the starting position and repeat for the other side of your body.
